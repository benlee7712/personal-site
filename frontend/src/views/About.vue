          Hi! I'm Ben, a software developer from the UK, working at <a href="https://kayenta.io" class="link-underline text-lapis lapis-link-underline">Kayenta.</a>
          The photography that you see on this website is a hobby of mine, and although I work on financial calculations, APIs and the like for a living, I find it
          really satisfying to work on web design from time to time... hence this website!
          <br/>
          <br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as my photography is concerned, I'm heavily inspired by brutalist and minimalist photography by the likes of
          <a href="https://www.josefhoflehner.com/works.html" class="link-underline text-dusty_red">Josef Hoflehner,</a>
          <a>&nbsp;</a>
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shirrenlim/?hl=en" class="link-underline text-dusty_red">Shirren Lim</a>
          and <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/pstd/hd_pstd.htm" class="link-underline text-dusty_red">Paul Strand</a>, although
          my subjects tend to be landscapes rather than the streets and architecture in their work. Having said that though, my main aim is to have a beautiful
          way in which to remember the things I've seen and done, so it follows that most of the work shown here is from various holidays I've been on over the
          years.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find myself most inspired to shoot exploring a place I've never been before with friends, family, or even by
          myself and aim to take photos that show a side of the place that wouldn't typically be seen while maintaining an obvious enough composition
          to make it easily recognisable.
